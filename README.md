# Memory-Management-Technique

Detailed Problem Statement can be found in Assignment6.pdf Question 2.

The program is meant to do a comparative study of paging system and non-paging system, also performance of paging system's dependence of several parameters such as page-replacement algorithm(LRU,FIFO,random) , swap-space size, page size.

The entire code is divided into 3 sub modules

Data Generator to simulate the data generation.
Non-Paging System implements the contiguos allocation(variable partition) technique using first fit algorithm.
Paging System implements paging system.


Memory Management Technique (MMT) Simulation
Developed a simulation program of several memory management techniques in C++.
Implemented demand paging system that loads pages from disk to memory on demand, a data-generator to
generate random data requests
LRU and FIFO page replacement algorithm is used.
Compared the performance of paging system between above mentioned page replacement algorithms.
Tools and Technologies used : C++.
